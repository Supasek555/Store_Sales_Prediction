But it's not automated and not applicable when there are newly added branch at new area.*\n\n### Q3.What are the data sets available for the problem? Where do they come from?\n\nAnswers: There are 4 main datasets we will be lookign for our understanding and train our data. The test_data.csv is for submission.\n#### 1. train.csv, comprises of these 4 attributes **(3,000,888 rows, 6 columns)**\n* **store_nbr** identifies the store at which the products are sold.\n* **family** identifies the type of product sold.\n* **sales** gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).\n* **onpromotion** gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date.\n\n#### 2. stores.csv, contains all information related to that city where the branch is opearted, comprises of 4 attributes. **(54 rows, 5 columns)**\n* Store metadata, including **city**, **state**, **type**, and **cluster**.\n* **cluster** is a grouping of similar stores.\n\n#### 3. oil.csv,daily oil price.  **(1,218 rows, 2 columns)**\n* Includes values during both the train and test data timeframes. (Ecuador is an oil-dependent country and it's economical health is highly vulnerable to shocks in oil prices.)\n\n#### 4. holidays_events.csv, Holidays and Events, with metadata **(350 rows, 6 columns)**\n* NOTE: Pay special attention to the **transferred** column. A holiday that is transferred officially falls on that calendar day, but was moved to another date by the government. A transferred day is more like a normal day than a holiday. To find the day that it was actually celebrated, look for the corresponding row where type is Transfer. For example, the holiday Independencia de Guayaquil was transferred from 2012-10-09 to 2012-10-12, which means it was celebrated on 2012-10-12. Days that are type Bridge are extra days that are added to a holiday (e.g., to extend the break across a long weekend). These are frequently made up by the type Work Day which is a day not normally scheduled for work (e.g., Saturday) that is meant to payback the Bridge.\n* Additional holidays are days added a regular calendar holiday, for example, as typically happens around Christmas (making Christmas Eve a holiday).\n\n\n### Q4.How are the results of the problem solution to be exposed?\n*Answer: Could be integrated to the exisiting forecasting tools of the company, for now the result of the prediction will be in 2 columns table in csv format file. The first column indicates id and the second indicates sales on that particular type of product on that day of the id. (Reference from the sample_submission.csv file)*\n\n### Q5.What type of problem is this?\n*Answer: Revenue leakage, the company tries to save more budget by only focusing on purchasing the products which are really needed at the right amount. If the stores are overly-prepared, they could end up generating lots of waste in case of perishable products and losing free money, while the under-prepared stores could end up having not enough product for the customer.*\n\n*Extract from the Compeitition description, \"For grocery stores, more accurate forecasting can decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction. The results of this ongoing competition, over time, might even ensure your local store has exactly what you need the next time you shop.\".*\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This
